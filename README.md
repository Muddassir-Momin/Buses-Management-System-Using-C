              The Bus Ticket Booking System is a software solution developed to simplify the ticketing process for public transportation services. Traditionally, bus ticket booking involves manual operations such as recording passenger details, tracking seat availability, and managing payment records. These methods are not only time-consuming but also prone to human error, leading to inefficiencies and dissatisfaction among users. This system addresses these challenges by providing an automated platform where users can book tickets, check seat availability, and manage booking records securely and efficiently.
